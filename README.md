A program that runs the Steam game, War Thunder when alt + f4 is pressed.

How to use it:
1- Download the exe
2- Open the exe
3- Play something
4- Rage quit the game with alt + f4
5- War Thunder is launched automatically

You can fork this shit to change the game that is launched but idk if this thing could be useful...
Originaly made for a very mentally ill friend who plays War Thunder Every Day
